code to automate my school work for math either through a remake of agentGPT or by trying to expose the website its self

the website prob does not send answer key to user but at the same time they hide dev tools and inspect element which means there might be something there they dont want to be found but im gonna do more research and rn im leaning towards the agentGPT

I have one problem for agentGPT and that is knowing what button to press for example if agentGPT sees a button and wants to press it what is a cheap way to turn what into where
